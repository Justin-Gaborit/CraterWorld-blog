			<h5 class ="text2 display-6 text-center mt-5">And so it Began</h5>
			<p class = "text2">I started working on my magnum opus game "TUBER" about 10 months ago. So far I'd say I'm a good 50% through with it's
				development cycle and implementing everything I want to put into it. The demo version is free to download <a href = "https://justingaborit.itch.io/tuber">"Here"</a> if you find yourself interested or wanting to give it a play. The game is pretty simple. I'ts an endless runner game where the payer can traverse a colorful tube shaped world hence the name "TUBER".</p>
