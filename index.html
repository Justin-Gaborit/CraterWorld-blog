			<p class = "text2">A lot of progress this week! I spent yesterday getting the outline shader implemented. luckily it was pretty easy because of the Unity shader editor. I'm not 100% sure if im in love with it yet, but I think it gives the game a pretty and iconic art style. Next up, I had to figure out how to handle level generation (or segment generation as I call it). Afterall, this is an endless runner, and I'm trying to generate segments of level for the player to navigate. I'll explain the code below, but first, here's what the level generation and shader ouline look like combined!</p>

			<p class = "text2 mt-3">So level generation is actually pretty simple, it's all based on object rotations. Each of the obstacles in the game are placed in different spots along the z axis, and each of these obstacles execute this script at runtime. The script works by generating a random value between 0 and 360 (as in degrees) and then applies that value to a vector3 that contains the rotation information for the object.
