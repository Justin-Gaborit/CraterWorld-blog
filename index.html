			<p class = "text2">Hi there! thanks for checking out my blog. This is my spot on the web where I post my own developement updates and my thoughts on phenomena taking place on the internet. Older posts can be found <a href = "https://craterworld.com/archive.html">'here'</a>. If you find yourself needing to get in touch with me please feel free to contact me through Twitter.</p>

			<p class = "text2">Recently, Tom and I decided we're gonna launch an app built on a preexisting codebase we have left over from a former project I developed last year. We decided the app would be an endless runner just like tempel run and subway surfers. So we got down to business, I spent the last week working on artwork and project setup while Tom starts looking into importing/formatting legacy code. After a couple days of concepting and 3D modelling I conjured up this low poly, unlit retro spaceman who the player will take control of. Everyone say hello to Space Joe! </p>

			<p class = "text2 mt-3">In our design doc we outlined an artstyle that we though would look best on bright mobile screens. The overall look of the game is gonna be unlit textures where every texture is derived from a two color gradient. when all is said and done, we get this cool soft fading texture look. Here's some rocks and crystals that the player is gonna try to avoid while moving through the game.

			<p class = "text2 mt-3">This little fella was inspired by a character I implemented into the last game I developed called <a href = "https://gamejolt.com/games/TUBER/600660">'TUBER'</a>. He works by shooting up from the crater below him after the player has hit a collision trigger placed before him in 3D space. The crater below him also does a good job of further outlining the artstyle we're going for.

			<p class = "text2 mt-3">After a week of work, I've scrapped up a rudimentary run cycle animation for Space Joe. It looks a little goofy and some of his limb movements aren't congruent and balanced, but luckily the unlit emission texture helps hide some mesh wierdness caused by the animation armatures.
